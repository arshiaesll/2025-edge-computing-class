# Assignment 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Assignment Author: Peyton Chandarana

## 0. Preliminaries:

This tutorial can be run on multiple different platforms of your choice:

- Locally
- Kaggle
- Google Colab

### Locally

Running the tutorial on a computer of your choice is completely fine and you may use the `environment.yml` file to reproduce the Conda environment that was used to develop this assignment. However, you must first have a form of Anaconda or Conda installed on your computer prior to starting the assignment.

To do this, I recommend using `miniforge` found here:

https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

Once you install Miniforge3 on your device use the following command to create the Conda environment:

```shell
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

**_NOTE: You may need to run the following command and restart your shell to initialize the `mamba` command! Using mamba versus conda has generally been faster in the past._**

```shell
mamba init
```

or be more specific by adding the shell at the end of the command:

```shell
mamba init /bin/bash
```

Once you have the Conda environment initialized, you can open the `main.ipynb` notebook in either VSCode (may require some extensions to be installed) or using a browser by launching the Jupyter Notebook server locally.

### Kaggle

We will be using Kaggle later so if you wish to use Kaggle for this assignment it should be familiar in subsequent assignments.

### Google Colab

Google Colab is another option to use for running this tutorial and is very similar to Kaggle.
