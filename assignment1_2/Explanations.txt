I started by making a VGG11 model and got accuracy of about 65%. Then I made VGG19 
that resulted in better accuracy of about 85% but the latency was too high. So I 
tried to make the MiniVGG that gave me the accuracy of 80% and a better latency. 
I levereged my macbook air GPU by converting the model into the coreML model which 
resulted in a 3x speed up.
